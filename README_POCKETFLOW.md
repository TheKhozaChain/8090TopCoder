# PocketFlow Solution for TopCoder Travel Reimbursement Challenge

This repository contains a comprehensive solution to the TopCoder travel reimbursement challenge using the **PocketFlow** framework - a minimalist LLM framework for building robust, maintainable AI systems.

## üéØ Challenge Overview

The challenge was to reverse-engineer a 60-year-old travel reimbursement system using:
- 1,000 historical input/output examples (`public_cases.json`)
- Employee interviews (`INTERVIEWS.md`)
- Three inputs: `trip_duration_days`, `miles_traveled`, `total_receipts_amount`

## üèóÔ∏è PocketFlow Architecture

Our solution demonstrates proper **Agentic Coding** methodology using PocketFlow's core abstractions:

### Core Components

1. **Nodes** (`reimbursement_nodes.py`): Individual processing units
   - `LoadReimbursementData`: Load and validate input data
   - `AnalyzeInterviewInsights`: Extract business rules from interviews
   - `AnalyzeDataPatterns`: Identify patterns in historical data
   - `SegmentCasesByType`: Group similar cases for analysis
   - `ExtractSegmentRules`: Extract rules per segment
   - `CreateUnifiedCalculator`: Build the final calculator
   - `TestCalculator`: Validate against test cases
   - `RefineCalculator`: Iteratively improve accuracy

2. **Flow** (`reimbursement_flow.py`): Orchestrates the entire pipeline
   - Implements proper error handling and retry logic
   - Manages data flow between nodes
   - Provides comprehensive logging

3. **Clean Implementation** (`clean_flow.py`, `clean_reimbursement_nodes.py`):
   - Anti-overfitting methodology
   - Proper train/validation/test splits
   - Generalization gap monitoring

## üìä Solution Performance

### Current Implementation
- **Average Error**: ~$119 on validation set
- **Methodology**: Domain knowledge from employee interviews
- **Approach**: Business rules extraction rather than pure data fitting

### Key Business Rules Discovered
1. **Base Per Diem**: ~$95-100/day with bonuses for longer trips
2. **Mileage Tiers**: Declining rates after initial miles
3. **Receipt Processing**: Optimal spending ranges with efficiency bonuses
4. **Trip Duration Effects**: 5+ day trips get additional bonuses

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Overfitting Measures

Our solution includes comprehensive overfitting prevention:

1. **Data Splitting**: 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test
2. **Complexity Control**: Model depth limitations and regularization
3. **Validation-Based Selection**: Choose models based on validation performance
4. **Generalization Monitoring**: Track train vs validation performance gaps

See `LESSONS_LEARNED_README.md` for detailed analysis of overfitting issues and solutions.

## üß† Key Insights

### Domain Knowledge vs Data Fitting
- **Winning Approach**: Extract business rules from employee interviews
- **Failed Approach**: Pure data memorization and lookup tables
- **Lesson**: Domain expertise often beats sophisticated ML when data is limited

### PocketFlow Benefits
1. **Modularity**: Each node handles one specific task
2. **Testability**: Individual nodes can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Debuggability**: Comprehensive logging and error handling
5. **Reusability**: Nodes can be reused across different flows

### Methodology Lessons
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic models before adding complexity
2. **Validate Early**: Use proper train/validation splits from the beginning
3. **Monitor Generalization**: Watch for overfitting throughout development
4. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of experiments and results

## üéì Educational Value

This solution serves as a comprehensive example of:
- **Proper ML Methodology**: Avoiding overfitting through good practices
- **Agentic Coding**: Human-AI collaboration in system design
- **PocketFlow Usage**: Real-world application of the framework
- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Using interviews and business context
- **Error Analysis**: Understanding when and why models fail

## ü§ù Contributing

This solution demonstrates best practices for:
1. Building robust AI systems with PocketFlow
2. Avoiding common ML pitfalls like overfitting
3. Integrating domain knowledge with data science
4. Creating maintainable, testable code
